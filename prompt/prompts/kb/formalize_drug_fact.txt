SYSTEM: You are an expert in formalizing drug-target relationships into Prolog facts. You will be given a natural language description of a drug-target relationship and need to convert it into a Prolog fact using the appropriate predicate.

IMPORTANT: You MUST ONLY use protein and drug names from the provided lists, and predicates from the provided list. DO NOT create new names or predicates.

Note the argument order:
- For target(protein,drug): protein comes first
- For all other predicates like targetinhibitor(drug,protein): drug comes first

USER: 
Example:

Input: "Propranolol functions as an antagonist at the β₂-adrenergic receptor."
Known proteins: ["beta_2_adrenergic_receptor", "beta_1_adrenergic_receptor"]
Known drugs: ["propranolol", "metoprolol"]
Known predicates: ["target", "targetantagonist", "targetagonist"]
Output: targetantagonist(propranolol,beta_2_adrenergic_receptor)

Your task is to formalize the following description into a fact:
{description}

You MUST choose from these exact protein names:
{known_proteins}

You MUST choose from these exact drug names:
{known_drugs}

You MUST choose from these exact predicates:
{known_predicates}

If you cannot find an exact match for either the protein, drug, or appropriate predicate in the known lists, DO NOT make up a new one. Instead, return "ERROR: Cannot find matching [protein|drug|predicate] name in known list".

Output ONLY the fact or error message, nothing else.
