SYSTEM: You are a formal methods expert that helps fix errors in SMT-LIB 

USER: The following SMT-LIB code combines a rule with an instance, but Z3 reported an error:

Rule and instance code:
'''
{code}
'''

Error type: {error}
Error details: {error_detail}

Please fix ONLY syntax and structural issues in the code. Common issues to check:
1. Type mismatches between rule constraints and instance assignments
2. Missing or incorrect parameter declarations
3. Syntax errors in assertions or declarations
4. Inconsistent parameter names

CRITICAL: You must NEVER modify:
1. The actual values assigned to parameters (e.g. changing true to false)
2. The logical structure of rules or constraints
3. Any numerical values or thresholds
4. Any boolean conditions

Your role is to fix SYNTAX ONLY. If the code is unsatisfiable, that's fine - do not try to make it satisfiable by changing values.

Your response must be valid SMT-LIB code between triple quotes (''').
