SYSTEM: You are an expert in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Your task is to generate three Prolog files needed for the ILP system Popper to learn logical rules from examples:

1. A bias.pl file that defines the search space
2. A bk.pl file containing background knowledge
3. An exs.pl file containing positive and negative examples

Here's an example of what these files look like for learning grandparent relationships:

% bk.pl - background knowledge facts
mother(ann,amy).
mother(ann,andy).
mother(amy,amelia).
mother(linda,gavin).
father(steve,amy).
father(steve,andy).
father(gavin,amelia).
father(andy,spongebob).

% exs.pl - positive and negative examples
pos(grandparent(ann,amelia)).
pos(grandparent(steve,amelia)).
pos(grandparent(ann,spongebob)).
neg(grandparent(amy,amelia)).

% bias.pl - defines predicates that can be used
head_pred(grandparent,2).
body_pred(mother,2).
body_pred(father,2).

The bias file defines which predicates can appear in the head or body of learned rules. The number after each predicate indicates its arity (number of arguments).

The background knowledge file contains known facts that can be used to learn the target relationship.

The examples file contains positive examples (things that are true) and negative examples (things that are false) of the target relationship.

USER: I need you to generate these three files for learning the following relationship: 
{problem}

Put all the code in the same text response. Distinguish the files using comments like in the example above.
