SYSTEM: You are an expert in symbolic reasoning. 
You will be provided with a premise statement and a hypothesis.
Your task is to:
(1) define all the predicates in the problem;
(2) Based on these predicates, parse the premise statement into logic forms as 'Facts' and 'Rules'.
(3) Parse the hypothesis into logic form as 'Query'. 
USER: Here are some examples:
###
Premise statement:
John has no keyboarding skills at all. If a person has no keyboarding skills at all, he/she will not be able to use a computer. And if a person is not able to use a computer, he/she will not be able to write essays using a word processing program. John has no keyboarding skills at all, so he cannot use a computer. Since John cannot use a computer, he cannot write essays using a word processing program. 

Hypothesis:
John cannot write essays using a word processing program.


Answer:
Predicates:
keyboarding($x, bool) ::: Does x have keyboarding skills?
computer($x, bool) ::: Is x able to use a computer?
write($x, bool) ::: Is x able to write your essays using a word processing program?

Facts:
keyboarding(John, false) ::: John has no keyboarding skills at all.

Rules:
keyboarding($x, False) >>> computer($x, False) ::: If you have no keyboarding skills at all, you will not be able to use a computer.
computer($x, False) >>> write($x, False) ::: If you are not able to use a computer, you will not be able to write your essays using a word processing program.
keyboarding(John, False) >>> computer(John, False) ::: John has no keyboarding skills at all, so he cannot use a computer. 
computer(John, False) >>> write(John, False) ::: Since John cannot use a computer, he cannot write essays using a word processing program.

Query:
write(John, False) ::: John cannot write essays using a word processing program.

Premise statement:
It is rainy today. If it is raining, the grass will be wet. If the grass is wet, we can't have a meal on the grass. If we cannot have a meal on the grass, we cannot have a picnic today.

Hypothesis:
We can't have a picnic today.


Answer:
Predicates:
rainy($x, bool) ::: Is it rainy at time x?
wet($x, bool) ::: Is x wet?
meal($x, bool) ::: Can x have a meal on the grass?
picnic($x, bool) ::: Can x have a picnic?

Facts:
rainy(today, True) ::: It is rainy today.

Rules:
rainy(today, True) >>> wet(grass, True) ::: If it is raining, the grass will be wet.  
wet(grass, True) >>> meal(we, False) ::: If the grass is wet, we can't have a meal on the grass.  
meal(we, False) >>> picnic(we, False) ::: If we cannot have a meal on the grass, we cannot have a picnic today.

Query:
picnic(we, False) ::: We can't have a picnic today.


<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Keep in mind that:
1. Use '>>>' to express entailment relations, and use '&&' to represent the conjunction of multiple conditions. DO NOT include any other special symbols.
2. Each rule must contain and only contain one entailment relation, namely, '>>>'.
3. You can use ::: to comment the semantic meaning for each expression.
5. You must follow this format: Predicate(object, True) for positive statements, and Predicate(object, False) for negative statements.
4. You must give me the logical expression in the above answering format. 


Premise statement:
{premise}


Hypothesis:
{conclusion}


Answer:
