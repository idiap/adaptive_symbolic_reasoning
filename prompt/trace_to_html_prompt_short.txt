# Trace to HTML Prompt (Compact Version)

Transform this symbolic reasoning trace into a clean, professional HTML visualization page.

## Input
Problem description and solver trace with generated code and results.

## Requirements

1. **Create self-contained HTML** with embedded CSS (dark theme, Inter font)
2. **Show prominently**:
   - Problem description (natural language)
   - Generated formal code (Prover9/Pyke/MiniZinc/Z3)
   - Final answer/result with status indicator
   - Reasoning steps or derivation process
   - Verification that constraints are satisfied

3. **Design style**:
   - Dark background (#0b1220), card panels (#111a2b)
   - Accent colors: cyan (#7cc4ff), purple (#b892ff)
   - Clean typography with clear hierarchy
   - Responsive grid layout
   - Code in monospace with syntax highlighting

4. **Critical rules**:
   - ✓ Extract ALL information from the trace accurately
   - ✓ Display complete formal code (this provides the formal guarantee)
   - ✓ Use visual aids: pills for status, chips for metadata, tables for data
   - ✗ Never invent information not in the trace
   - ✗ When adding interpretations/diagrams, clearly label them as such

5. **Structure**:
   ```
   Header (title + solver info)
   → Result Summary (answer, status, metrics)
   → Problem Description (natural language)
   → Generated Code (formal syntax)
   → Reasoning Process (steps/derivation/proof)
   → Verification (show constraints satisfied)
   → Footer
   ```

6. **For different problem types**:
   - **CSP**: Show constraints, variable assignments, capacity usage
   - **FOL**: Show axioms, proof steps, logical notation (∀, ⇒, ∧)
   - **LP**: Show facts→rules→derived predicates chain
   - **SMT**: Show assertions, SAT/UNSAT result, model if SAT

## Key Principle
**The formal code execution provides epistemic trust. Your visualization should make this transparent and understandable, not replace it with interpretations.**

Output complete, valid HTML that can be saved and opened in any browser.
