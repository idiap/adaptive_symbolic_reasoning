    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Question Parsing:** Automatically separates and identifies individual questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heterogeneous Reasoning:** Applies different solvers to different problem types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallel Execution:** Processes independent questions concurrently when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Evaluation:** Provides per-question accuracy metrics\n",
